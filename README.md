# AI-DEX

## Overview
This is a decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) built using Next.js and React. It allows users to swap between different cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchains. The project supports popular chains and tokens, and includes user-friendly features such as slippage tolerance settings and transaction deadline management.

The goal of this project is to to start with an MVP front-end that is similar to what most DEX players provide, and incorporate an AI Agent overlay to bridge the user's native intent.
